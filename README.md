# sensorflare_codesend
a python wrapper that allows communication between sensorflare and 433MHz devices on a RaspberryPi using codesend and wiringpi.

In order to use this daemon you need, a RaspberryPi, a 433MHz RF Transmitter, wiringpi and 433Utils, and a Sensorflare account.

## wiringpi

[WiringPi](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/) is an Arduino wiring-like library written in C and released under the GNU LGPLv3 license which is usable from C and C++ and many other languages with suitable wrappers.

More information about installing WiringPi can be found [here](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/download-and-install/).

## codesend

`codesend` is provided by 433Kit.
433Kit is a collection of code and documentation designed to assist you in the connection and usage of RF 433MHz transmit and receive modules to/with your Arduino and Rapberry Pi.
`433Kit` is provided by [ninjablocks](https://github.com/ninjablocks/433Utils).
